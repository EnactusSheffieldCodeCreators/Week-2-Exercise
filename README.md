# Week-2-Exercise

## The Deep End

This week the exercises are much harder, you probably will get stuck at some point, that's expected. Just try to get as far as you can, and when you reach a problem you really can't solve either ping a message to the discord server or bring it up in the mentoring session on Sunday. Try to avoid just looking at the solutions unless you think you've solved that part first.

## Part 1 - Um, Uh, Vim!

The first challenge this week is to take the [week 1 lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alTRvtmWi7k&t=2s) and using the subtitles that YouTube auto-generates, write a script that counts the number of times that Jack said "um" or "uh". To help you along here's a list of words that may highlight some considerations to make while designing the detection portion of the code.

- umbrella
- um.
- magnesium
- um, yeah.
- um...

Finally you will have to use a library to do this, don't attempt to write out the subtitles and try to avoid just downloading a txt file because it won't be as useful in the later sections of the exercise.

# Part 2 - Catchphrase!

Now that we have all this information from the video subtitles, the next challenge is to work out what Jack's catchphrase for the lecture is. This means finding the phrase that he said the most through the entire lecture, there's many different ways to tackle this so see what result you get.

## Ideas for exercises.

- Calculate words per minute.
- ~~Find jack's catchphrase.~~
- Generate a word-cloud for the lecture.
- Graph words per minute.
- Graph his passion with time by plotting the inverse number of ums.
- Compile all Jacks ums.
- Auto-tune to song/keyboard.
